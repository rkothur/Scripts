1. Login to the Server/laptop
2. Create a folder C:\batch (If you don’t want to use this path, you will have to modify the PowerShell script to point to a different path)
3. Download the batch.zip file attached to the email to the above folder and extract it. The zip file contains two files -
   a. Servers.txt – Contains a list of all DataNodes (HBase + worker nodes)
   b. Port-Check.ps1 – Script that runs a port scan against port 1022 on all the servers in the servers.txt file
4. Open “Windows PowerShell” from the start menu
5. Cd to C:\batch and execute the PowerShell by running ./Port-Check.ps1
6. It will take a while to execute because of the number of servers in the list
7. The script to create a new output file under the same folder called Port-Check-Output.txt and this file will show the list of all open/closed or filtered hosts.

Port-Check.ps1:
$host_entry = Get-Content C:\batch\servers.txt
$Port = 1022

$OutFile = "C:\batch\Port-Check-Output.txt"
if (Test-Path $OutFile) {
   Clear-Content $OutFile 
}

Foreach ($hst in $host_entry)
{
  "Checking $hst for Port $Port"
  $Socket = New-Object Net.Sockets.TcpClient
  $ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
  $Socket.Connect($hst, $Port)
  $ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'
  if ($Socket.Connected) {
        "${hst}: Port $Port is open" | Add-Content -Path $OutFile
        $Socket.Close()
  } else {
        "${hst}: Port $Port is closed or filtered"  | Add-Content -Path $OutFile
  }
  $Socket = $null
}
